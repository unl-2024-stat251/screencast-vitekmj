1: I will do a small bit explaining what data I have by showing the tidy tuesday site
2: Then I will talk about about my initial thoughts about the data.
3: Talk about my project proposal
4: Talk about my prelim thoughts on its executions.
5: Talk about the steps I have picked (ESPECIALLY WHY) 
5.5: Talk about data filtering
6: Explain course content upon implementation of a method
7: Talk about final results and compare that to expecttaions.

I should have a final dataframe that shows the correlation between the metrics I have selected. This should be all layed out evenly in one table. These metrics should be the names of teams, underlying data and the manipulated data (ie PAKE/G) and the correlations. 

I will make sure to include: 
1. Graph making
2. Reshaping/filtering data
3. Data joining
4. Data manipulation/cleaning
